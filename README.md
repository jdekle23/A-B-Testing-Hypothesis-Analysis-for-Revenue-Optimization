## 📌 Project Overview

The challenge was to determine whether a taxi fare's **payment method (credit vs. cash)** influences the **fare amount paid** — a key question for optimizing driver income.  
Using sample data from a controlled experiment, this A/B test explores potential revenue impacts and supports causal inference through proper statistical rigor.

## 🎯 Goals

- Use **descriptive statistics** to explore fare data.
- Formulate and test **null and alternative hypotheses**.
- Run a valid **A/B test** comparing two customer groups.
- Derive clear, stakeholder-friendly insights and recommendations.
